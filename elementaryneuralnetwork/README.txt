There is implemented elementary neural network with back propagation described on http://rfhs8012.fh-regensburg.de/~saj39122/jfroehl/diplom/e-index.html in this folder.
It's an assignment on Neural Network course. It's sample task that was implemented in learning purposes.
Network had as input & output binary arrays that are generated randomly. It has small learning set to balance weights, during process of learning error rate is being reduced due to repeated cycles with back propagation.
Basic structure is depicted on drawing.png.
Networks of this kind used to, particularly, pattern recognition. For example, images can be translated into binary arrays in special way and than exposed to processing by network.
File Form1.cs contains code on C# (Windows Form), sample.exe is implemented programme.
Also folder contains screens of program with different results depending on defined parameters (random-pattern-....png). There is commented part from theoretical example of network described on site in code, the corresponding screen is from_theoretical_example.png.
